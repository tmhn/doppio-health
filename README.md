#DoppioHealth
DoppioHealth iOS Application

iOS Application to incorporate with [DoppioHealth](https://github.com/tmhn/doppio)

##Installation
```bash
git clone

cd DoppioHealth

npm install

npm start

open ios/DoppioHealth.xcodeproj
```

##Purpose

The purpose of this project is to allow healthcare professionals to produce small _Micro-Apps_ for patients that they can use to monitor their health and lifestyle. 

###Micro-Apps

The healthcare professional generates the _Micro-App_ from the DoppioHealth website using Visual Programming, the _Micro-App_ then is updated to the patient's iPhone. 

###Bundles

The options for _Bundles_ are Diet, Recorder, Tips and Guidance


##Principles

* DoppioHealth consumes a Theme file that is a collection of all styles, keeping components lightweight

##Further Work
_\( not to be confused with [ToDos](https://github.com/tmhn/doppio-health/blob/master/todo.md) \)_

* Integrate with an auto-updater library to allow users to recieve specific updates
* Danger Levels - If you have taken a medicine, then an alert will show if you are close to the recommended dosage
