DoppioHealth iOS Application

iOS Application to incorporate with DoppioHealth

##Installation

git clone
cd DoppioHealth
npm install

##Project

The purpose of this project is to allow healthcare professionals to produce small "AppBundles" for patients that they can use to monitor their health and lifestyle. The healthcare professional generates the "AppBundle" from the DoppioHealth website using Visual Programming, the "AppBundle" then is updated to the patient's iPhone.
